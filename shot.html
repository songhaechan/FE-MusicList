    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <p><xmp>
        I feel it burnin'
        Won't you let me out
        And set me free again?
        The clock is ticking
        But am I ready to go out
        And start again?
        Is this home?
        The place where I used to feel so whole
        Now there are cracks up on the walls
        Suddenly it doesn't feel like home
        Do I have to smile
        And pretend?
        But I don't think I can take this
        Shot
        To my body
        I don't feel like I belong
        I don't feel like I'm somebody
        That I know
        Or if I know you
        Do you know how much it hurts me?
        Now you're just another memory to forget
        Do you wonder
        How did our happy ending go?
        I thought you had it in your hands
        Must've lost it when we dance, oh, well
        Do I have to smile
        And pretend?
        But I don't think I can take this
        Shot
        To my body
        I don't feel like I belong
        I don't feel like I'm somebody
        That I know
        Or if I know you
        Do you know how much it hurts me?
        Now you're just another memory to forget
        Yeah
        Just another memory to forget
        Just another memory
        You're just another memory to forget
        I'm so used to loving you
        Never wanted to leave you
        Do I have a place to go?
        I have never felt this empty alone
        I can't take this shot
        To my body
        I don't feel like I belong
        I don't feel like I'm somebody
        That I know
        Or if I know you
        Do you know how much it hurts me?
        Now you're just another memory to forget
        Shot
        To my body
        No, I don't feel like I belong
        I don't feel like I'm somebody
        That I know
        Or if I know you
        Do you know how much I love you?
        Do you know how much I care?
        Now you're just another memory
